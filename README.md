Vi Sync is a simple program made to copy files between two folders and sync them together

Installation: 

  1. Ensure that you have .NET 8.0 installed (you can check if you do by running `dotnet --list-runtimes` in your terminal)  
  If you don't have it, download from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (on linux there will usually be a package called dotnet-runtime-8.0 or similar)

  2. Download ViSync-Windows.zip or ViSync-Linux.zip from the latest [release](https://github.com/silly-Violet/ViSync/releases/), extract the contents and run ViSync.exe / ViSync.sh (you may have to edit the properties on linux to allow executing file as a program)
